# play-java-context-variables
Simple project to demonstrate use of some of the variables implicitly available from a Play! Framework template
A list of(what I believe to be) all the implicit variables can be found at https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/api/java/play/mvc/Http.Context.Implicit.html
(although earlier versions of Play! do not offer all of these).
